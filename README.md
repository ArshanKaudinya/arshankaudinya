### Change is the one constant, so I build around it.


I’m building a lot of things, and I’m obsessed with compounding: shipping useful software, tightening my thinking, and upgrading my body and mind in the same direction.

Plenty of people chase “the next big thing”. I’m more interested in becoming sharper than I was yesterday, because that’s the one asset that survives every market, mood, and milestone. Money is the output, not the goal.


I like meeting new people - Different values, different habits, different worlds. I love to see perspectives.
